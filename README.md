## Description

Created this project utilizing coinpaprika's public API for the purposes of utilizing React-Query. Unfortunately, much of the API's previously free calls have been blocked by a new paywall, so older chart features I had prior is now unavailable unless I purchase certain tier access of the API.

Roadmap:

- [ ] Convert to TypeScript
- [ ] Explore other API's to utilize (free and paid)
- [ ] Integrate graphical charting library with new API data
- [ ] Add the news portal
- [ ] Serverside pagination/rendering
- [ ] Next 13+ - this is an app that would greatly benefit from RSC
